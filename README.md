ðŸ“š Learning Python Projects

Welcome to my Learning directory! ðŸš€ This section contains small, beginner-friendly Python projects that I created to strengthen my understanding of fundamental concepts.

ðŸ”¥ What You'll Find Here

    Basic Syntax â€“ Variables, Data Types, Operators
    Control Flow â€“ If-Else, Loops
    Functions & Modules â€“ Writing and Using Functions
    File Handling â€“ Reading & Writing Files
    OOP Basics â€“ Classes & Objects
    Small CLI Projects â€“ Simple interactive scripts

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

These projects are meant to practice and reinforce Python fundamentals. They are not production-ready but serve as stepping stones towards writing better and more efficient code.

ðŸš€ What's Next?

As I progress, I will move towards more advanced projects, which will be found in the Professional directory.
